# Diabetes Prediction Using ML Algorithms

we will be predicting that whether the patient has diabetes, nodiabetes or prediabetes on the basis of the features we will provide to our machine learning model, and for that we will be using the diabetes_012_health_indicators dataset.

## Techniques Used
- Data analysis: *Here one will get to know about how the data analysis part is done in a data science life cycle.*
- Exploratory data analysis: *EDA is one of the most important steps in the data science project life cycle and here one will need to know that how to make inferences from the visualizations and data analysis*
- Machine Learning Modeling: *Here we will be using 3 ML models KNN, Naive bias, Logistic Regression and then we will choose the best performing model.*
